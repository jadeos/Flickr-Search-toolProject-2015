# Flickr-Search-toolProject-2015
I created a flickr search tool using the flik API

I had to get a key from flickr so that i could use there service. Then I embedded the key in my javascript code.
The key was used to search elements with a different tag name. 
However, I was unable to link the tags with the user input, i just put random tags instead.
